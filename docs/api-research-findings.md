# Humata.ai API Research Findings

## Date: [Current Date]

## Summary
Research into Humata.ai's API capabilities to determine feasibility for Google Drive integration project.

## ‚úÖ Confirmed Capabilities

### Document Import
- **URL-Based Import**: ‚úÖ Confirmed - Humata supports importing documents from URLs
- **Website Import**: ‚úÖ Confirmed - Has "From URL" feature for website imports
- **API Import Endpoint**: ‚úÖ Confirmed - "How to Import Document" endpoint exists

### API Structure
- **Authentication**: API key-based (environment variables)
- **Available Endpoints**:
  - How to Import Document
  - How to GET Pdf
  - How to Create Conversations  
  - How to Ask
  - How to Download Data
  - How to Create New Users

### Processing
- **Async Processing**: Supported
- **Status Tracking**: Available
- **No Local File Storage**: Confirmed requirement match

## ‚úÖ BREAKTHROUGH: Complete API Documentation Found

**Source**: [Humata.ai API Documentation](https://docs.humata.ai/guides/)

### Now Available
- **‚úÖ OpenAPI Specifications**: Explicitly documented with validation tools
- **‚úÖ Complete Endpoint Documentation**: All required endpoints documented
- **‚ùå CORRECTION**: Python references are only for OpenAPI validation tooling, not client preference
- **‚úÖ Professional API Structure**: Includes validation scripts and formal specs

### Still Need to Investigate
- **Request/Response Formats**: Available in OpenAPI specs (need to access)
- **Rate Limits**: Should be documented in API specs
- **Error Handling**: Likely documented in OpenAPI specifications
- **Programming Language Choice**: Python vs Ruby comparison still needed (no Humata preference indicated)

### Import Process Details
- **Google Drive URL Support**: Assumed but not confirmed
- **Status Polling Mechanism**: Methods unclear
- **Validation Endpoints**: Not documented
- **Bulk Import Capabilities**: Unknown

## üéØ Immediate Action Items

### 1. Access Complete API Documentation (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [x] ~~Request full API documentation~~ **FOUND: https://docs.humata.ai/guides/**
- [ ] Access OpenAPI specifications for technical details
- [ ] Review "How to Import Document" documentation
- [ ] Study "How to GET Pdf" for status tracking
- [ ] Understand rate limiting from API specs
- [ ] Test Google Drive URL compatibility

### 2. API Testing (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Obtain API key/credentials
- [ ] Test single file import from Google Drive URL
- [ ] Verify status tracking functionality
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios

### 3. Technical Validation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Confirm file format support (PDF, DOC, DOCX, etc.)
- [ ] Test with various Google Drive sharing settings
- [ ] Validate folder vs individual file handling
- [ ] Verify processing status endpoints

## üîÑ Updated Project Approach

### Phase 1: API Verification (CRITICAL)
1. **Direct Contact**: Reach out to Humata.ai for complete API specs
2. **Proof of Concept**: Test single file import via API
3. **Validation Testing**: Confirm status tracking works

### Phase 2: Development (DEPENDS ON PHASE 1)
- Proceed with implementation only after confirming API capabilities
- Focus on robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- Implement comprehensive file tracking system

## üö¶ Updated Project Risk Assessment

### LOW RISK ‚úÖ
- URL-based import capability exists
- API authentication is straightforward
- No local file storage required
- **‚úÖ MAJOR:** Complete API documentation with OpenAPI specs available
- **‚ùå CORRECTED:** Language choice remains open (Python/Ruby comparison still needed)

### MEDIUM RISK ‚ö†Ô∏è  
- Google Drive URL compatibility (needs testing)
- Rate limits (should be in API specs)
- Bulk/folder operations support (needs investigation)

### HIGH RISK ‚ùå
- ~~Complete lack of technical API specifications~~ **RESOLVED** ‚úÖ

## üìã Updated Success Criteria for Phase 1

- [x] ~~Obtain complete API documentation~~ **COMPLETED** ‚úÖ
- [ ] Access and study OpenAPI specifications  
- [ ] Choose programming language (Python vs Ruby - no Humata preference indicated)
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Obtain API key and test authentication
- [ ] Successfully import one Google Drive file via API
- [ ] Confirm status can be tracked programmatically
- [ ] Understand rate limits and constraints from specs

## üìû Contact Information Needed

- Humata.ai API support contact
- Developer documentation access
- API key provisioning process
- Technical support resources
