## Project: Humata.ai Google Drive Import Tool

**Goal:**  
A Ruby CLI tool to import publicly accessible files from Google Drive folders into Humata.ai using a 3-phase workflow, with SQLite-based state management. Each import session uses its own SQLite DB file.

---

### Key Architecture & Design Decisions

- **CLI with Subcommands:**  
  - `discover` (GDrive crawl)  
  - `upload` (send to Humata)  
  - `verify` (check processing status)  
  - `run` (all phases in sequence)  
  - `status` (progress reporting)
- **SQLite:**  
  - One DB file per session  
  - Only a `file_records` table, denormalized per file
- **Idempotent Phases:**  
  - Each phase can be safely re-run; no built-in retries, just rerun the phase
- **Batch/large-scale support:**  
  - Designed for thousands of files

---

### Implementation Status

**Phase A: Foundation & Core Infrastructure**  
- Project setup, dependencies, and main module file created  
- Database foundation: SQLite connection, schema, and file record model with CRUD  
- CLI framework: command routing, argument parsing, base command class

**Phase B: Google Drive Integration**  
- Google Drive API client (`GdriveClient`) implemented:
  - Service account authentication
  - Recursive folder crawling with file metadata extraction (id, name, mimeType, webContentLink, size)
  - Handles pagination and subfolders
  - Note: Uses recursion; for very deep folder trees, an iterative approach may be needed due to Ruby's lack of tail call optimization

**Schema changes:**  
- `file_records` table now includes:
  - `humata_import_response` (full API response from import-url)
  - `humata_verification_response` (latest API response from status endpoint)
  - (Legacy `humata_response` has been replaced/renamed as above)

**All changes are reflected in the implementation plan and architecture design.**
