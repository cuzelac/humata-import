## Project: Humata.ai Google Drive Import Tool

**Goal:**  
A Ruby CLI tool to import publicly accessible files from Google Drive folders into Humata.ai using a 3-phase workflow, with SQLite-based state management. The tool is designed for one-time, large-scale imports, with each SQLite database file representing a single import session.

---

### Key Architecture & Design Decisions

- **Single CLI with Subcommands:**  
  - `humata-import discover` (GDrive crawl)  
  - `humata-import upload` (send to Humata)  
  - `humata-import verify` (check processing status)  
  - `humata-import run` (all phases in sequence)  
  - `humata-import status` (progress reporting)
- **SQLite as Data Store:**  
  - One database file per import session  
  - Only a `file_records` table (no session table)  
  - All file metadata, Humata folder ID, and API responses are denormalized per file
- **Idempotent Phases:**  
  - Each phase can be safely re-run; no built-in retries, just rerun the phase
- **Batch/large-scale support:**  
  - Designed to handle thousands of files efficiently

### Implementation Status

**Plan Location:**  
- `docs/plans/humata-import-implementation/implementation-plan.md` (follows project’s plan-creation-iteration rules)

**Phases/Deliverables Completed:**  
- **Phase A, Deliverable 1:**  
  - Project setup: `Gemfile`, `humata-import.gemspec`, `.gitignore`, and `lib/humata_import.rb` created  
  - Dependencies: `sqlite3`, `google-api-client`
- **Phase A, Deliverable 2:**  
  - Database foundation:  
    - `lib/humata_import/database.rb` (SQLite connection, schema creation for `file_records`)
    - `lib/humata_import/models/file_record.rb` (basic CRUD and status update methods)

**Next Step:**  
- Phase A, Deliverable 3: CLI Framework (command routing, argument parsing, base command class)

---

### Reference Files

- **Architecture:** `docs/architecture-design.md`
- **Requirements:** `docs/project-requirements.md`
- **Implementation Plan:** `docs/plans/humata-import-implementation/implementation-plan.md`

---

**How to continue:**  
Pick up with Phase A, Deliverable 3 in the implementation plan, or review/adjust any previous work as needed.
