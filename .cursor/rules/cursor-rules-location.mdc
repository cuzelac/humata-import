description: Cursor Rules Location Rule
globs: *.mdc
alwaysApply: false

## Description
This rule ensures that all new MDC (Model-Driven Code) rules are created in the `.cursor/rules` directory, maintaining a consistent and organized structure for rule management.

## Rule
When creating new MDC rules:
1. All new MDC rules MUST be created in the `.cursor/rules` directory
2. Each rule MUST be in a separate file
3. Rule files MUST use the `.mdc` extension
4. Rule files MUST follow the naming convention: `[rule-name].mdc`
5. Rule files MUST contain proper markdown formatting with YAML frontmatter
6. **Glob patterns in frontmatter MUST NOT use recursive patterns like `**`**

## Frontmatter Requirements
All MDC rule files MUST include proper YAML frontmatter with the following structure:
```yaml
---
title: [Rule Title]
description: [Brief description of the rule]
globs: [file pattern without recursive globs]
alwaysApply: false
---
```

### Glob Pattern Constraints
- **MUST NOT** use recursive directory patterns like `**`
- **MUST NOT** use complex path traversals like `spec/**/*_spec.rb`
- **SHOULD** use simple patterns like `*.rb`, `*_spec.rb`, or `*.mdc`

### Examples of Valid Glob Patterns
✅ **Good:**
- `*.rb` - matches all Ruby files
- `*_spec.rb` - matches all test files
- `*.mdc` - matches all MDC files

❌ **Bad:**
- `spec/**/*_spec.rb` - uses recursive pattern
- `src/**/lib/*.rb` - uses recursive pattern
- `**/test_*.rb` - uses recursive pattern

## Implementation
- The Cursor IDE will enforce this rule by:
  - Automatically creating new MDC rules in the `.cursor/rules` directory
  - Preventing creation of MDC rules outside this directory
  - Maintaining separation of rules into individual files
  - Ensuring proper file extensions and naming conventions
  - Validating glob patterns to prevent recursive patterns

## Benefits
- Improved organization and maintainability
- Easier rule discovery and management
- Consistent rule structure across the project
- Better version control and tracking of rule changes

## Examples
✅ Correct:
```
.cursor/rules/
  ├── mdc-rules-location.mdc
  ├── another-rule.mdc
  └── third-rule.mdc
```

❌ Incorrect:
```
.cursor/
  ├── rules/
  │   └── mdc-rules-location.mdc
  └── other-rules/
      └── another-rule.mdc
```
